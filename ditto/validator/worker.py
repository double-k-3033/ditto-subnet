"""The validator epoch loop: queue -> score -> weights.

One sweep: pull agents in ``evaluating`` from the platform, score each through
dittobench-api (by presigned tarball URL), and report the signed score back.
Weight-setting is **decoupled** from that sweep: weights are recomputed from the
platform's persistent best-score *ledger* (``/scoring/scores``) and set every
epoch — even when nothing new was scored — via the KOTH+ATH mechanism. This is
the fix for the one-epoch-weight bug: the old loop built weights only from the
current ``evaluating`` set, so a scored agent (which leaves that queue) was
zeroed the next epoch. Failures scoring one agent are logged and skipped — one
bad submission must not stall the sweep or block weight-setting for everyone.

        When a current-version challenger's effective composite sits inside the

        inside seed-luck range: the champion's confirmation composites are a
        frozen draw and the challenger holds one commit-reveal seed, so
        neither side's dataset difficulty cancels. Re-score the champion and

        fold's next read decides on the PAIRED statistic
        (weights._paired_dethrone), which cancels per-seed difficulty.

        Anchoring the seeds to the champion (not the contested cohort) is what
        bounds the work: the seed set does not move when a new challenger
        appears, so already-settled challengers keep sharing the champion's
        seeds and are never re-scored, and the champion is re-scored only until
        it carries those seeds once. A newly appearing challenger costs one
        confirmation, not a re-run of the whole cohort. Clear wins and clear
        losses never trigger this. One member failing to re-score is logged

        ``detail`` is the reporter's own code behind ``reason``, from
        :func:`~ditto.validator.errors.failure_detail`. ``reason`` is a
        three-value class chosen to drive the platform's reissue policy, so it
        says how the platform should respond and nothing about what happened;
        ditto-subnet#279 classified twelve dead ``mnemo*`` leases off it and
        still could not name the fault. Optional on both sides of the wire, so
        omitting it is always safe.

        ``log_tail`` is the failing harness's own output, from
        :func:`~ditto.validator.errors.container_log_tail`. Where ``detail``
        carries the code an operator groups by, this carries what they read.
        Also optional on both sides, and travelling separately for that reason:
        folding free-form miner output into ``detail`` would turn the one
        machine-groupable field back into prose.

        Closing the live lease lets the next :meth:`request_job` mint a fresh
        ticket instead of resuming the failed attempt. Strictly best-effort: an
        old platform without ``/validator/job/fail``, or any transport/validation
        error, must never crash the sweep — the ticket then simply expires on its
        own deadline exactly as it did before this endpoint existed.

        Bounded, because "best-effort" must not mean "unbounded". This is the
        call that turns a lease into a resolved ticket, and it is reached from
        the abort path with only the reporting margin left; a platform that
        accepts the connection and then stalls would otherwise spend the margin
        here and produce the silent expiry the abort exists to prevent.
