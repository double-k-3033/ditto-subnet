description: Safely read SN118 production Platform Postgres, Platform API pm2 logs, GCE screener-worker journals, historical Cloud Run screening-job logs, and Platform app-VM disk inventory via gcloud. Use for prod DB lookups, counts, audits, EXPLAIN ANALYZE, API 500 tracebacks, screener fleet bootstrap or stuck-worker diagnosis, historical Cloud Run job failures, live screening-build diagnosis, or a host disk-full during platform-deploy. Never prints credentials.

# Read-only SN118 production debug

Use the bundled scripts. Do not print credentials, open a free-form remote shell, or mutate production.

Pick the smallest surface that answers the question. Corroborate logs with the database and the live `/health` commit. W&B remains `$wandb-ops`.

## Database

Credentials stay in `/opt/ditto-platform/.env` on the production VM. Never use `gcloud secrets versions access` for this workflow.

```bash
.agents/skills/gcloud-ditto-readonly/scripts/query_prod_db.sh 'SELECT count(*) FROM agents'
.agents/skills/gcloud-ditto-readonly/scripts/query_prod_db.sh ./query.sql
printf '%s\n' 'SELECT now()' | .agents/skills/gcloud-ditto-readonly/scripts/query_prod_db.sh -
.agents/skills/gcloud-ditto-readonly/scripts/explain_analyze_prod_db.sh 'SELECT agent_id FROM agents WHERE status = '\''evaluating'\'' ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 50'
```

1. Refuse writes, DDL, permission changes, and maintenance commands.
2. Inspect `ditto/db/models.py` and Alembic when names are uncertain.
3. Select only needed columns, filter by exact identifiers, `LIMIT` row dumps, aggregate for counts.
4. Report facts vs deployed code vs live state separately. Redact tokens, passwords, private object URLs, and full artifacts.

Target is project `ditto-app-dev`, zone `us-central1-a`, instance `ditto-platform-prod`, env `/opt/ditto-platform/.env`. Connect through IAP. Default statement timeout 30s; `DITTO_DB_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS` at most 120000.

JSON `null` is not SQL NULL: `col IS NOT NULL` is true for a stored JSON
`null`, so presence checks on jsonb payloads (for example
`observation->'review_audit'`) must compare against `'null'::jsonb` or the
"present" branch silently includes empty values.

## PostgreSQL recovery diagnostics

For a database that rejects connections during recovery, use the fixed,
read-only host diagnostic (no SQL or credentials):

```bash
.agents/skills/gcloud-ditto-readonly/scripts/inspect_platform_postgres.sh
```

The manual `Diagnose Platform PostgreSQL` workflow runs this same bounded
script from main under the protected prod environment and the existing
Platform deployment identity. It accepts no remote commands or target inputs,
changes no IAM, and never restarts PostgreSQL or modifies WAL/data files.

## Platform API logs

The API runs under pm2 as `ditto-api` (user `deploy`). Live logs are
`/opt/ditto-subnet/apps/platform/logs/`; `/opt/ditto-platform/logs/` is the
pre-cutover tree and is stale — check file mtimes before trusting either, and
re-resolve with `pm2 describe ditto-api` if the layout has moved again.
`ditto-api.err.log` is empty by design: access lines, app logging, and
unhandled-exception tracebacks (`error_envelope ... unhandled exception in
request handler`) all land in `ditto-api.out.log`, which is multi-GB and
unrotated — never cat it; use the bounded script.

```bash
.agents/skills/gcloud-ditto-readonly/scripts/read_platform_logs.sh tail 200
.agents/skills/gcloud-ditto-readonly/scripts/read_platform_logs.sh grep 'submission-source-reviews/.*complete' 3 120
.agents/skills/gcloud-ditto-readonly/scripts/read_platform_logs.sh grep 'unhandled exception' 10 200
.agents/skills/gcloud-ditto-readonly/scripts/read_platform_logs.sh --file relay-1 tail 100
```

A request line ending `-> ERR in Nms` is immediately followed by the
traceback. VM app logs do NOT ship to Cloud Logging; `gcloud logging read`
on `resource.type="gce_instance"` finds nothing.

## GCE screener workers

Production screening workers are ephemeral instances labeled
`env=prod,role=screener-fleet`. Discover the current names and zones first;
never assume a previous instance still exists. The bounded helper opens no
free-form shell and reads only the bounded worker logfile or
`ditto-screener` systemd journal through IAP SSH. Its `audit` mode reads the
retention-bounded, transcript-free L2 provenance journal; use it to correlate
private failure codes with the analyzer tools already attempted.

```bash
.agents/skills/gcloud-ditto-readonly/scripts/read_screener_worker_logs.sh list
.agents/skills/gcloud-ditto-readonly/scripts/read_screener_worker_logs.sh logs ditto-screener-fleet-ab12 500
.agents/skills/gcloud-ditto-readonly/scripts/read_screener_worker_logs.sh audit ditto-screener-fleet-ab12 20
.agents/skills/gcloud-ditto-readonly/scripts/read_screener_worker_logs.sh journal ditto-screener-fleet-ab12 15 500
```

Correlate worker journal evidence with Backroom `get_screener_capacity` and the
exact screening attempt. A RUNNING VM or successful startup script is not a
healthy worker: require a current Platform heartbeat, a stable GCE target, and
an actual lease claim or polling loop. Keep reads bounded to 1-1440 minutes and
1-2000 lines.

A throttled review model turn logs `signature=http-status=429` from L1
(`retrying same turn` / `parking attempt`) and L2/L3 (`L2/L3 model request
failed`). When the gateway returned an error envelope, the line also carries
`provider_limit=key_rpm|upstream_capacity|credits`: a fixed category inferred
from the gateway error. Raw provider messages are never logged because they can
echo request or credential content, even in an error-only response. If the
category is absent, the numeric status alone does not identify the limit. It
never reaches the public failure code. Do not run arbitrary SSH commands, restart services, edit the VM,
or read environment/credential files from this skill.

## Cloud Run screening job logs

Cloud Run jobs in the retained one-shot screening stack log only
to Cloud Logging, and Platform's `replica_logs` stub returns `""` for Cloud
Run, so the DB replica-trace columns are empty for gcp rows — Cloud Logging
is the only artifact. The rental loop deletes failed jobs after capture, so
`gcloud run jobs describe` usually 404s.

Job names (from the launching Platform loop): Kaniko builds are
`ditto-miner-build-<build_id hex[:12]>`, source reviews are
`ditto-source-<review_id hex[:16]>`, runtime smokes are short-lived internal
Services. Worker stdout/stderr is in `run.googleapis.com%2F{stdout,stderr}`;
`Container called exit(N)` lands in `run.googleapis.com%2Fvarlog%2Fsystem`
(builder stage exit codes 71-76 mean SOURCE/KANIKO/ARCHIVE/UPLOAD/COMPLETE/
CONTRACT); execution-level failures in `cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fsystem_event`.

```bash
gcloud logging read 'resource.type="cloud_run_job" AND resource.labels.job_name=~"ditto-source-" AND severity>=WARNING' \
  --project=ditto-app-dev --freshness=4h --limit=30 \
  --format='value(timestamp, resource.labels.job_name, textPayload)'
gcloud logging read 'resource.type="cloud_run_job" AND resource.labels.job_name="ditto-miner-build-<build12>"' \
  --project=ditto-app-dev --freshness=6h --limit=25 \
  --format='value(timestamp, logName, severity, textPayload)'
```

Resolve the name suffix from the Platform row (`build_id` /
`review_id`), not from `provider_resource_id` (often cleared after release).

## Host disk

Read-only inventory when `platform-deploy` fails with `No space left on device`
during `git fetch`. `/tmp` is tmpfs and does not free `/`.

```bash
.agents/skills/gcloud-ditto-readonly/scripts/inspect_platform_disk.sh
```

Cache reclaim and boot-disk growth are `$ditto-subnet-release-ops`
([`platform-host-disk.md`](../ditto-subnet-release-ops/references/platform-host-disk.md)).
Do not truncate live logs, delete relay traces, or resize the disk from this
skill.

## Failures

If gcloud/SSH/Secret Manager auth fails, report the non-secret error and suggest `gcloud auth login`. Do not hunt another credential store or print `.env`. If a DB statement is rejected, keep it as `SELECT`/`WITH`/`TABLE`/`VALUES`/`EXPLAIN`/`SHOW`. If Postgres reports a read-only violation, stop.
