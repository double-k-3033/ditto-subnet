# Federated screener capacity

The normal production path is one fixed-cost 64 GB Hetzner node named
`subnet-screener-1`, with the existing GCE MIG retained at zero as outage and
backlog-overflow capacity. Platform owns admission and leases; Backroom owns
the revisioned provider and per-node concurrency settings. See
[`docs/hetzner-screener-fleet.md`](../../docs/hetzner-screener-fleet.md) for the
default-Debian install and Ansible runbook.

## Provider order and safety gate

For each reconciliation the
controller:

1. reads the current Platform demand and renews its fenced lease;
2. reads the audited Backroom provider revision;
3. treats the configured Hetzner node heartbeat as the primary availability
   signal;
4. keeps GCE at zero while the primary is ready and unclaimed backlog is at or
   below `max(min_backlog, screening_concurrency * backlog_multiplier)`;
5. adds only residual GCE capacity above that threshold, or full bounded GCE
   capacity when the primary is not ready;
6. publishes the lower desired GCE target when demand falls, while deferring
   physical deletion until existing leases finish and new claims can be fenced
   throughout it.

The scale-in planner re-reads the node inventory after the fenced renew because
a GCE worker may claim after the first read.
Scaling to zero checks that `legacy_gcp_running_attempts` is zero and every
running managed-group member has a fresh idle heartbeat. Even after a clean
reread, it defers deletion: the ready controller snapshot blocks new legacy
claims only until its 180-second lease expires, while the physical GCE resize
can still be in progress. Partial scale-in also defers because the shared
legacy hotkey has no per-instance claim fence. A deferral leaves the managed
group unchanged while publishing the lower desired target, which blocks new
claims for a fresh, ready controller. After controller authority expires,
current-policy emergency fallback can admit claims again; no deletion is in
progress. It publishes `GCE_SCALE_IN_DEFERRED` and is not a provider failure.
Its `gce_target_changed` and `gce_scale_in_deferred` events are sent when the
deferral begins, not on every pass. A new desired target or MIG size sends
both again, as does a lower target that returns after a pass stopped scaling
in (such as an inventory hold, a routing outage, or a live GCE lease); a new
deferral reason sends only the deferral event. Physical excess capacity
requires a durable claim fence or an operator-controlled drain.

`SCREENING=0` (`screening_concurrency=0`) on the primary is an operator closure,
not an outage: it is a global full stop recorded as
`HETZNER_PRIMARY_ADMISSION_CLOSED`, and GCE does not overflow it regardless of
backlog, `gce_overflow_enabled`, or the host's readiness and heartbeat, so a
host health failure cannot reopen screening. Reopening needs a deliberate
`screening_concurrency >= 1` activation on the primary. GCP-first provider
routing cannot bypass this stop. A primary the controller cannot vouch
for -- a failed node-inventory read, an omitted primary row, or a row without
its admission setting -- also fails closed (`HETZNER_PRIMARY_UNKNOWN`), so an
inventory outage cannot bypass an operator stop. Only a primary known to be
open but unready is a host failure that overflows to GCE. A stale routing
revision that still names the retired Targon provider first honors the same
closed and unknown stops; its GCE fallback (`RETIRED_PROVIDER_ROUTING`) applies
only to a primary known to be open.

A Platform deploy or transient 5xx on the routing or node-inventory read must
not flap the GCE MIG. The controller holds the current GCE target, in both
directions, for `--inventory-failure-hold-passes` consecutive failing passes
(default 4, about two minutes) and reports `PLATFORM_INVENTORY_UNAVAILABLE`. The
hold never adds capacity. A routing read failure reuses the last good revision
cached in the controller state file, so running GCE workers still match the
Platform claim check. Without a cached revision, the controller publishes an
unready revision 0 (`PROVIDER_ROUTING_UNAVAILABLE`) and preserves the current
MIG size until an authoritative routing read succeeds; it neither adds
capacity nor deletes workers on an unknown route. A cached revision also
preserves the current MIG size for the full routing outage, including after
the transient hold expires. After that hold, a routing or node-inventory read
failure marks the controller unready so the independent watchdog can use
current Platform policy to supply an open primary's backlog. A closed or
unknown primary keeps the watchdog at zero. Node-inventory failures still
follow the normal controller rules after the hold: an unknown primary fails
closed. The first successfully
fenced failing pass records a
`platform_inventory_unavailable` event and the expiry records
`platform_inventory_hold_expired`. A failed pre-event read or first fenced
renew leaves the transition pending for the next pass.

Capacity transition events are delivered at least once, not exactly once. The
controller records an event as sent, in its state file, only after the renew
that carries it succeeds, and Platform has no event idempotency key. A renew
whose response is lost, or a crash or failed state write right after a
successful renew, can send that event once more on the next pass. A state file
that cannot be written at all stops each pass at its first write, before any
renew. The best-effort `provider_mutation_failed` event is not retried.

Production uses `['hetzner', 'gcp']` for build, runtime smoke, and source review.
The second entry means that separate GCE workers may claim still-unclaimed
submissions when the capacity policy activates them. It does not mean a failed
Hetzner lane is retried on GCE.

- **Hetzner primary** (`['hetzner', 'gcp']`): one full worker process starts the
  canary under one enrolled node identity. After the canary, Platform initially
  admits two build/smoke KVM slots and two review slots on the 64 GB host, with
  a matching two local worker processes.
- **GCE-only** (`['gcp']`): an audited emergency posture in which GCE workers
  run the whole build, smoke, and review pipeline locally.


Within one submission, static execution-safety preflight runs first, followed
by build, runtime smoke, general source review, and verdict. General review is
never leased before the exact attempt has both a successful build and smoke.
Different submissions move through those stages concurrently.

A revisioned write requires compare-and-swap, an audit reason, and an exact
confirmation string covering all three lists and the overflow policy. Node
screening, shared sandbox, build, runtime, and review ceilings have a separate
append-only control. New nodes default to zero capacity.

## Capacity event retention

`screener_capacity_events` is an append-only audit table, so Platform prunes it
instead of letting reconciliation and provider lifecycle events accumulate.

- **Window:** 30 days by default, set with
  `SCREENER_CAPACITY_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS`. `0` keeps every event and disables
  pruning; any other value must be at least 7, so a typo cannot erase incident
  history. The window in effect is returned as `event_retention_days` by
  `GET /api/v1/admin/screener-capacity` (and therefore `get_screener_capacity`),
  with `null` meaning pruning is off.
- **Mechanism:** a Platform-role janitor sweeps hourly. Each sweep is **one
  transaction** that takes a transaction-scoped advisory lock, lists the
  environments holding events once, then runs up to 20 batches inside it, each
  deleting at most 1,000 expired events **per environment** against the
  `(environment, created_at)` index. Because the lock lives as long as that one
  transaction, another Platform replica cannot start a sweep of its own between
  batches, so replicas share a single deletion budget per sweep. Every
  environment has its own budget, so a backlog in one cannot starve another, and
  an environment stops being visited once a batch comes back short. Readers keep
  seeing recent history while it runs (MVCC). An event exactly at the cutoff is
  kept. A failure rolls back the whole sweep, so nothing is half-deleted, and the
  next sweep retries it.
- **Signals:** `ditto_screener_capacity_event_janitor_runs_total{outcome}`
  (`deleted`, `busy`, `error`), `ditto_screener_capacity_event_janitor_deleted_total`
  and `ditto_screener_capacity_event_janitor_duration_seconds`. The deleted
  counter moves only after the sweep commits, so it never counts rows that a
  failed sweep rolled back; a `busy` outcome means another replica owns the
  sweep. Alert on a sustained `error` rate; failures are also logged as
  `screener capacity event janitor sweep failed`.

## Stand-up order

No repository merge deploys or mutates production. Keep the existing GCE MIG
available at zero, merge and deploy Platform/Backroom/controller support, then
follow the dedicated-host runbook. Enrollment alone grants zero capacity.

First rehearse the public host role on Terraform's optional
`subnet-screener-dev-1` (`n2-standard-16`, nested KVM, no runtime secrets), then
return `enable_screener_fleet_dev_host` to false and prove the disposable VM is
absent. The dedicated-host runbook contains the exact protected workflow and
Ansible commands.

After `subnet-screener-1` is converged, use Backroom to:

1. verify its node ID, Hetzner resource ID, exact release SHA, image digest,
   heartbeat, and zero effective limits;
2. keep existing provider routes and every node limit at zero while host-local
   cold build, smoke, failed-build/no-review, and failed-smoke/no-review probes
   pass (shadow mode);
3. append the one-lane canary setting
   `SCREENING=1 SANDBOX=1 BUILD=1 RUNTIME=1 SOURCE_REVIEW=1`;
4. set all three provider lists to `['hetzner', 'gcp']` and enable overflow for
   `subnet-screener-1` at multiplier 3, minimum backlog 12, maximum 6;
5. prove one production build -> smoke -> source-review sequence and one
   build failure that never obtains a review lease;
6. raise the 64 GB node to
   `SCREENING=2 SANDBOX=2 BUILD=2 RUNTIME=2 SOURCE_REVIEW=2`, set the private
   inventory to two worker processes, and prove two simultaneous cold
   build/smoke lanes without memory or disk pressure; raise to three only after
   measured sandbox-plus-review memory leaves safe host margin;
7. exercise one controlled stale-heartbeat event and one above-threshold queue,
   proving GCE claims new work and preserves active leases; verify the desired
   target returns to zero, then drain physical excess capacity under operator
   control;
8. drain retired nested-Docker Targon worker nodes. Do not re-enable them.

The exact Debian, inventory, vault, Ansible, activation, verification, and drain
commands live in [`docs/hetzner-screener-fleet.md`](../../docs/hetzner-screener-fleet.md).

## BuildKit cache cleanup on dedicated screener hosts

The `screener_worker` role installs `ditto-screener-cache-gc.timer` and its
oneshot service. The active `hetzner_screener_fleet` role now includes the
same cache-only tasks for its persistent full screening workers, using their
rootless executor socket and `ditto-screener` service identity. The disposable
KVM build guests keep isolated per-job caches; this timer does not enter those
guests or touch the host's rootful Docker daemon. It backs up the rootless
executor's own builder GC
(`workers/screener/deploy/rootless-daemon.json`, `defaultKeepStorage` 40GB) by
running `docker builder prune --force --keep-storage <budget> [--filter
until=<age>]` against the rootless executor socket only. BuildKit skips records
used by an in-flight build, so a timer firing mid-build does not interrupt it.
The job never uses `--all`, `docker system prune`, or image/volume/container
pruning.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `screener_cache_gc_enabled` | `true` | `false` stops and disables the timer |
| `screener_cache_gc_on_calendar` | `hourly` | systemd cadence (plus `screener_cache_gc_randomized_delay: 5min`) |
| `screener_cache_gc_keep_storage` | `40GB` | retained cache budget; keep equal to the daemon budget |
| `screener_cache_gc_min_age` | `1h` | records younger than this are never pruned; empty (`""`) means no age floor, by design |
| `screener_cache_gc_df_path` | executor home | filesystem logged with `df -h`; the executor home (`/var/lib/ditto-screener-docker`) holds the daemon's data root, so it is the cache's mount. `df` of the home itself works for the unit user despite mode 0700; a path beneath it would not |
| `screener_cache_gc_dry_run` | `false` | log policy and disk state, skip the prune |

This timer is the second pass, not the only one: `update-screener.sh`
(`maintain_cache`, ~line 313) already runs `docker builder prune --keep-storage`
against the same rootless executor, and the daemon's builder GC is the
continuous limit. The keep-storage budget therefore lives in THREE places
(`rootless-daemon.json`, the updater's `SCREENER_CACHE_KEEP_STORAGE`, and
`screener_cache_gc_keep_storage`) and must stay equal. The age floor is small
on purpose: `update-screener.sh` (~line 324) uses no age filter because a floor
exempts burst-created cache, which is exactly what overruns the budget; 1h only
protects records from the current burst's in-flight builds, and `""` removes it.
The timer's unit orders `After=` the executor but never `Wants=` it, so it can
never start the daemon; an unreachable executor fails the run visibly.

The 40GB budget deliberately preserves warm layers so requeued and resubmitted
builds stay fast (cold builds exceed nine minutes, see #429); lowering it trades
throughput for headroom. The host disk must leave room above the budget. Each
run logs `docker system df` and `df -h` before and after to journald under
`ditto-screener-cache-gc`; a failed prune or unreachable executor exits nonzero,
leaving the unit in `failed` state.

On Hetzner, `screener_fleet_cache_gc_*` controls this same policy. It is enabled
only when `screener_fleet_runtime_enabled` is true, so a disposable rehearsal
host never starts the timer. The persistent full workers use a 100GB budget in
both the rootless daemon and the timer. A changed daemon budget restarts the
rootless Docker service during converge, so drain builds first. A warm-cache
speedup must be measured from actual full-worker build durations afterward.

Inspect and operate manually (as an operator, against the rootless socket):

```bash
systemctl list-timers ditto-screener-cache-gc.timer
systemctl status ditto-screener-cache-gc.service
journalctl -u ditto-screener-cache-gc.service --since -1d
export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/ditto-screener-docker/docker.sock
docker system df; docker system df -v | sed -n '/Build cache/,$p'; df -h /
sudo systemctl start ditto-screener-cache-gc.service   # run the bounded policy now
docker builder prune --keep-storage 40GB --filter until=1h  # manual, same policy (asks for confirmation)
```

Emergency reclaim (interrupts warm-cache performance, never while a build is
active: check `docker ps` first): `docker builder prune --all --force`.

Coverage and UNVERIFIED items. CI runs the script's unit tests (fake `docker`),
renders the units, and runs `tasks/cache_gc.yml` in `--check` mode for the
enabled and disabled policy. That is not an idempotency or systemd test; a real
idempotent second apply cannot be exercised in CI. Nothing here is proven on a
real host. Before #541 can close, a dev host must confirm: `docker builder prune
--keep-storage ... --filter until=...` behavior on the executor's Docker
version; `systemd-analyze verify` on the units; the unit running as the deploy
user with `SupplementaryGroups` under the hardened sandbox; that editing the
cadence variables re-arms the running timer (a handler restarts it); and the
before/after `docker system df`, `df -h`, timer status, and heartbeat health.

Rollout: converge the host with the existing screener Ansible path (protected
workflow, `--check --diff` first). Production verification records, before and
after: `docker system df`, `df -h`, `systemctl status
ditto-screener-cache-gc.timer`, and the screener heartbeat health in Backroom.

## Rollback

Apply all three lanes as GCE-only to restore the GCE screening path after an
audited Backroom revision. Stop the controller unit only after explicitly
setting the GCE MIG to a safe nonzero target or confirming the queue is empty. The
`ONLY_SCALE_OUT` watchdog is intentionally incapable of deleting workers during
a controller outage.

Drain `subnet-screener-1` before host maintenance. Removing the node, GCE
resources, or any deletion protection remains a separate reviewed operator
action.
