"""cover node court-key failures in the infra-failure index

Revision ID: 6a7a2a03a65f
Revises: 111add4c7a2a
Create Date: 2026-09-29

``INFRA_AUTO_RETRY_REASON_CODES`` now also retries a worker's
``source-review-adjudicator-key-unavailable`` failure: the source-review court's
API key file on that node was unset, unreadable, too short, or readable by
group/other, so the court never started (#2449). The fleet breaker scan under
the global claim lock filters on exactly that tuple, so the partial
``screening_attempts_infra_failed_idx`` from ``5e2a8c4f9d17`` must name all four
codes or the scan falls back to a sequential walk.

The predicate is duplicated in ``models.py`` and
``screening_infra_retry._infra_failure_filters``; keep all three in step.

Build the replacement ``CONCURRENTLY`` under a temporary name before dropping
the old index, so the claim-lock breaker scan retains an index throughout.

A concurrent build is not atomic. A lock timeout or deadlock in any of its waits
cancels it after its catalog entry committed, leaving an INVALID index under the
build name, and a retried ``CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS`` then
"succeeds" on that leftover without building anything. So every attempt re-reads
the catalog and drops whatever sits under the build name unless it is valid with
exactly the target definition (table, access method, key column, uniqueness, and
the predicate's code set), then builds again. The same check lets a re-run
recover from an interrupted build, drop, or rename, and replaces a stale index
under either name rather than keeping or swapping it in.

The ``CONCURRENTLY`` statements run under a longer, still bounded
``lock_timeout`` than env.py's session default. That short default protects
traffic from a statement queued for an exclusive table lock. A concurrent build
or drop takes only ``SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE`` on the table, which conflicts with
DDL, VACUUM, and ANALYZE but never with reads or writes, and its waits for older
transactions block nobody. Under the short default, any transaction in the
database that outlives it cancels the build.
