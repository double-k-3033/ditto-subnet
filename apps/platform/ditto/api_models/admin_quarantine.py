# code of its own instead of inheriting the code the reviewed quarantine was
# opened with. Those are two different facts — "why the screener held this
# submission" and "what an operator decided about the hold" — and reusing one
# field for both is how a submission the screener cleared ends up labelled with
# the code that cleared it. The vocabularies are disjoint by construction: no
# screening-origin code starts with ``operator-``, so a bare code still says
# which of the two a reader is holding.
#
# Named for the object ruled on, not the outcome, so they cannot collide with
# ``_OPERATOR_REJECT_REASON_CODE`` (``operator-rejected-screening``) minted by
# the pre-quarantine ``/screening-submissions/{id}/reject`` route. That
# route's retry guard treats its own code as proof it already ran, so a shared
# token would make it report a quarantined submission as its own idempotent
# retry; the two routes are different actions with different preconditions and
# stay separately named.
