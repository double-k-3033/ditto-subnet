"""Screener-facing endpoints — the cheap pre-evaluation gate.

The worker in the private ``ditto-screener`` repository drains freshly uploaded agents,
does a lint + compile + build check on each tarball, and reports a verdict.
A pass promotes the agent ``uploaded -> evaluating`` so the validator queue
picks it up. A deterministic submission failure becomes ``rejected``; a
    infrastructure failure becomes parked ``screening_failed`` work.

The platform stays thin: it owns the state machine + the queue only. The build
check lives in the worker. These endpoints mirror ``/validator/*`` so the two
workers look identical to an operator.

Lifecycle + scope decisions (documented so they're easy to revisit):

- **Queue = new uploads and explicitly authorized manual retries.**
  Two-score provisional contenders drain by score so likely winners can reach
  quorum; other submissions drain by fewest accepted scores, then arrival order.
- **Verdict is a direct promotion.** A pass sets ``evaluating`` (not
  ``screening_passed``). A deterministic fail sets ``rejected``; an
  infrastructure fail parks as ``screening_failed``. Re-reporting the same
  verdict is idempotent; a conflicting or late verdict is a 409.
- **Dedicated auth.** Every request carries a bearer token and the configured
  screener hotkey. Result POSTs additionally verify the hotkey's sr25519
  signature over the verdict and its policy version.
- **Every verdict names the caller's claimed attempt.** A result without an
  ``attempt_id``, or naming an attempt that is not this caller's claim for this
  agent and policy version, is a 409 with no state change.
