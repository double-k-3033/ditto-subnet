"""Public, unauthenticated read endpoints for the subnet dashboard.

Three surfaces, all open (no credentials) and fronting the same DB the
validator-gated ``/scoring/scores`` reads:

* **Aggregate leaderboard / health** (``/leaderboard``, ``/health``): best score
  per payment-time coldkey, composite plus tool/memory means and rank, never
  exposing per-case answer-key detail. This half stays aggregate-only.
* **Submission lifecycle** (``/activity``, ``/agent/{id}/pipeline``): recent
  uploads, public pipeline stage, safe screening evidence, and accepted numeric
  scores as they arrive. In-progress score rows carry reproducibility inputs but
  omit validator identity, signatures, ticket leases, and scorer internals.
* **Per-submission transparency** (``/submissions``, ``/agent/{id}/scores``): the
  k=3 record for a finalized agent: *which* validators scored it, each one's
  exact numbers + signature, the median the platform finalized on, and the pinned
  dataset (seed + sha256). This deliberately exposes ``validator_hotkey`` (a
  public on-chain identity) and the raw ``seed`` so anyone can reproduce and audit
  a score; because the platform draws the seed after screening, publishing it
  post-hoc never lets a miner pre-overfit. It still omits the per-case answer key.
  Continual retest seeds are reused across a cohort and are never published;
  only their score aggregates are public.
  See ``docs/public-telemetry.md``.

Responses are cacheable (``max-age=30``) so a CDN / the dashboard can front this
cheaply; the underlying rows only change when a sweep records a new score. The
leaderboard includes a read-only projection of the validator's frozen KOTH fold
so raw score rank is never mistaken for the emissions champion. Validators remain
the authority that independently computes and submits the real weight vector.

    The read is cached and refreshed in the background rather than run per

    generating the dataset take a couple of minutes, so a quarter hour still in

    the container).

    **``running_benchmark``.** Previously excluded outright, on the reasoning
    that the stage can legitimately run to the validator's 75-minute cap. That
    left the longest stage of the run — the one where a wedge is most likely and

    against its *own* reported count rather than against wall-clock alone: each
    completed check buys ``_BENCHMARK_STALL_PER_CHECK`` of elapsed time on top of
    a fixed startup grace. A healthy run earns headroom far faster than it spends
    it (v7 sits near 4s/check against a 60s allowance), so a genuinely
    progressing benchmark is never mislabelled; a frozen one crosses the line and
    stays crossed.

    This is deliberately *not* the same question as "is the validator still
    reporting". A stalled run has a fresh heartbeat and a frozen count; a stalled
    *stream* has a stale ``seen_at`` and is surfaced as ``online``/
