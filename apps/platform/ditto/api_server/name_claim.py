"""Signed miner handle claims: what is signed, and how a name is reserved.

Anyone can upload an agent named ``Jupiter-ditto-v10``. The rightful owner of
the Jupiter handle has no cryptographic way to say "that name is mine" -- the
only remedy today is a Discord conversation. This module is the replacement.

A miner signs a claim over a **name stem**. Other miners who already have a
scored payment-owner family -- entrenched operators, not a fresh hotkey --
endorse that claim. Once enough distinct families have signed, the stem is
reserved to the claimant's owner family: new uploads that collide are
rejected, and existing collisions are stricken from public display as
``Unnamed submission``.

What is a stem
--------------
``Jupiter-ditto-v10``, ``jupiter``, and ``JUPITER_v2`` are the same handle.
Version tokens, ``ditto`` / ``sn118`` / ``subnet`` / ``miner`` filler, and
separator differences collapse away. The stem is what is reserved, so a
copycat cannot dodge the reservation by appending ``-v11``.

What is bound into each signature
---------------------------------
- a **domain tag + version** so a claim signature cannot be replayed into
  upload, owner-link, or validator lanes;
- the **netuid**, so a claim minted on another deployment cannot land here;
- the **stem**, the **signer identity**, and (for endorsements / withdrawals)
  the **claim id**, so a captured signature cannot be retargeted;
- a **nonce** (unique, replay-guarded) and **issued_at** (freshness window).

Endorsers must be entrenched
----------------------------
An endorsement is only accepted from a payment-owner family whose earliest
full-benchmark scored submission was uploaded at least
:data:`ENTRENCHMENT_AGE` ago. Uploads that never earned a full-benchmark
score do not count toward that age. One endorsement per owner family. The
claimant's own family cannot endorse itself. Brand-new miners cannot
manufacture a quorum.

The claim does not move emissions or rewrite ``agents.name``. It only
governs the public name: an upheld reservation hides colliding names
and blocks later uploads of that stem.
