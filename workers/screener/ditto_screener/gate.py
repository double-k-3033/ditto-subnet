"""Stable v6 screening core plus an optional private policy boundary.

The gate is deliberately cheaper than a full DittoBench run. It verifies the
image and service contract before a submission can consume a scoring run.

Flow for one agent:

1. **Download + verify.** Stream the presigned tarball to a temp file, bounded by
   ``max_tarball_bytes``, and re-check its SHA-256 against the queue value (the
   URL is presigned but the bytes are still attacker-controlled).
2. **Contract check.** Reject unsafe archive entries and require a root
   ``Dockerfile`` before any build is attempted. The implementation language is
   deliberately unconstrained; the image must satisfy the HTTP harness contract.
3. **Build.** Load an exact preverified image for a guarded replay, or build the
   submitted Dockerfile in the worker's isolated Docker executor.
4. **Serve smoke.** Run the image detached with a memory + pids cap and poll
   ``GET /health`` until it returns 2xx, then prove the harness can ingest
   with one bounded ``POST /seed`` wave (``SCREENER_SEED_PROBE_MODE``:
   ``shadow`` records the signal, ``enforce`` makes it a contract failure,
   ``off`` skips it). The probe is served by the same isolated fake gateway, so
   it costs no provider call.
5. **Private policy.** The default v8 manifest performs bounded Luna source
   review after health. A rotating
   private manifest may use timing, random-control, fingerprint, and behavioral
   audit modules. Those signals can only pass or route to review; they cannot
   produce a deterministic rejection.
6. **Teardown.** The container + image are always removed.

A pass is "built, served, and cleared by bounded source review" under the
default production-v8 manifest.
Deterministic contract violations fail; infrastructure failures are reported
separately so Platform can park them for an operator-issued retry.
Failures include a short ``detail``
(response body, container-log tail, or failing stage) for the miner and operator.
Every stage is best-effort and never raises into the worker loop: an
infrastructure error (Docker down) is reported as a non-pass with detail, so a
flaky host does not silently promote or wrongly reject.

Trust posture: the Docker endpoint is operator-owned and may be required to be
rootless by deployment policy. Build and runtime wall-time and resources are
bounded; no submission-controlled credential is mounted into either boundary.

        ``bench_version`` is the exact generation Platform assigned to this
        submission. Private behavioral challenges reuse it so the challenge
        envelope cannot drift from the scored request contract.

        ``deadline`` is an optional monotonic-clock (``loop.time()``) bound for
        the whole screen, derived by the worker from the platform's lease. When
        set, each heavy stage is clamped to the remaining budget and refuses to
        start once the budget is spent, so a slow build or source review can no
        longer run past the lease and have its verdict rejected as expired.

        ``build_only`` selects the mechanical lane. It is used for both an
        already-adjudicated prerequisite rebuild and score-first admission
        whose deep source review is deferred. It skips source review but still
        performs archive/contract validation, build, serve, isolation, and
        image-export work. A mechanical screen can only pass, report a genuine
        deterministic or infrastructure failure in those stages, or run out of
        lease budget; private-policy checks run in the later full review.

        ``deferred_source_review`` distinguishes a fresh score-first admission
        from an already-adjudicated rebuild for the signed platform contract.
        Both mechanical paths skip private-policy work here.

        ``policy_only`` selects a stale-policy rescreen whose previously
        verified image and runtime smoke are retained by Platform. It reruns
        archive/source policy checks without rebuilding, serving, or exporting.

        ``scored_runtime_evidence_received_at`` is the wall-clock second the
        claim carrying ``scored_runtime_evidence`` arrived. The signed lease's
        freshness is judged against it, so build and L1 time cannot age it out.

        ``source_only_build`` inventories and builds a fixture in an isolated
        namespace, then runs L1/L2 source policy without serving the image or
        loading any private challenge bank. It has no publish callback.
