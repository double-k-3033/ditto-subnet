"""The screener sweep loop.

One sweep: lease one eligible agent from the platform, screen it through the
build gate, and post a lease-bound signed verdict. Agents are processed one at
a time because builds are heavy and serial execution keeps host load predictable.

A single bad submission or a transient platform error must never stall the loop:
each agent is guarded, and a failed platform call is logged and retried next
sweep. The loop drains promptly when the queue is non-empty and sleeps
``poll_seconds`` when it is idle, exiting cleanly when ``stop`` is set.
