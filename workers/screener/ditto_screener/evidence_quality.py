"""Admissibility of a cited source location as anti-cheat evidence.

The source reviewer's output is untrusted model text. ``source_review`` already
drops citations that point at a member the archive does not contain, or past the
end of a readable file, before the finding is digest-bound — a hallucinated
location must never become signed evidence.

This module extends that same idea from "does the location exist" to "can the
location carry a behaviour". The review policy requires a finding to name the
trigger and the effect of a causal path. A blank line, a comment, a `use`
statement, a `#[derive]`, or a lone closing brace is none of those things: it
compiles to nothing, so it cannot be a trigger and cannot be an effect.

This is deliberately *not* a claim that the surrounding code is safe, and it is
not a hiding place. Nothing here removes a line from the reviewer's view — every
file is still read in full and every rule still runs over it. The filter changes
only what may be *cited as proof*, which is why it cannot be used to smuggle a
violation: a violation that executes is, by construction, on a line that is not
inert.

Two exemptions keep the filter from eating load-bearing evidence:

- ``#[cfg(...)]`` / ``#[cfg_attr(...)]`` attributes stay admissible. They are the
  reachability gates a submission can flip between versions to bring dormant
  code to life, so an attribute-only line can genuinely be the trigger.
- Only lines that are *wholly* inert are dropped. A single line carrying both a
  signature and a body (``fn a(x: &str) -> String { table(x) }``) is code, and a
  trailing comment after a statement does not make the statement prose.
