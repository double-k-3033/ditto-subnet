# Ditto Screener

Platform-operated screening worker for Ditto SN118 submissions.

The stable core leases one submission at a time from `ditto-platform`,
downloads and verifies its tarball, enforces safe language-neutral Docker
rules, builds the Docker image, starts it with resource caps and an internal fake
gateway, waits for `/health`, then performs a bounded, read-only Luna source
review before submitting a lease-bound sr25519 result. An optional, default-off
GPT-5.6 Terra level-2 reviewer can resolve only medium/high L1 leads with an
isolated, no-network coding-analysis harness. Terra is primary; OpenRouter may
fall back to the configured GLM/SOL models only after an upstream model error.
A complete, very-high-confidence medium-risk certificate from primary Terra may
clear directly; every static/high-risk,
incomplete or lower-confidence safe result requires the
independent GPT-5.6 SOL level-3 critic. A SOL challenge is decided by a second,
low-reasoning SOL adjudicator rather than becoming an automatic violation.
Obvious single-mechanism violations stop at L2; mixed benchmark/scorer/tool
violations use a bounded SOL cause adjudicator before retaining quarantine.
Reachable generator-shaped or review-adaptive model routing cannot be released
by model agreement alone; a location-bound deterministic hold preserves
quarantine without becoming a terminal rejection.
For `benchmark_emulation` and `scorer_contract_manipulation`, L2 evidence v2
also requires artifact-bound `served_trigger`, `authority_bypass`,
`scorer_visible_effect`, and `reachability_link` roles plus the exact changed
field or outcome (`final_text`, `answer`, `abstain`, `tool_calls`, the
validator-observed trajectory, or the graded outcome). `off` retains the L1
finding without running L2, `shadow` records the v2 candidate while returning
the exact L1 finding, and `enforce` accepts only a role-complete,
transition-compatible v2 finding. Missing, opaque, or budget-limited causal
proof is inconclusive and never becomes an unsupported quarantine finding.
Medium- and high-risk results are
quarantined for operator review, never automatically rejected. The default
manifest never calls `POST /run`. It never reads or writes the platform database.

The health smoke mirrors the validator runtime contract: UID/GID 65532, a
read-only root filesystem, a bounded noexec `/tmp` tmpfs, dropped capabilities,
private IPC, bounded local logs, and a locked
`DITTOBENCH_DB=/tmp/dittobench.db`. Images declaring implicit writable volumes
are rejected. An image is never exported if
it only boots as root or depends on writing elsewhere in its root filesystem.

Production builds use a dedicated rootless Docker daemon. Rootless verification
is enabled by default, including for standalone workers. The worker checks
Docker's advertised `rootless` security option before accepting work; a missing
or rootful endpoint becomes a retryable infrastructure result, never a miner
failure. The build receives no
credentials, cannot request host networking or insecure BuildKit entitlements,
and non-root host traffic is denied access to cloud metadata except DNS.

On a pass, the worker exports the exact verified image with `docker image save`,
hashes the archive, and uploads it sequentially in bounded multipart chunks.
Each storage request has a finite timeout and bounded retry policy; failures
trigger a best-effort multipart abort and the local archive is always removed.
The platform streams the completed object to verify the full archive SHA-256
before acknowledging it. The worker then binds that verified upload ID, archive
digest, byte size, immutable Docker image ID, and image reference into the
canonical signed verdict. Validators can therefore load the screened image
instead of repeating the untrusted build.

Verdict submission retries the same signed payload across transient HTTP,
transport, and node-credential refresh failures. A missing signing key stops
authentication retries immediately. A definitive 400, 413, or 422 verdict
rejection triggers one best-effort, signed infrastructure fallback for the same
attempt (`worker-verdict-rejected`), with bounded private rejection diagnostics.
Authentication failure before any verdict dispatch uses
`worker-verdict-auth-failed`. A 409 conflict, transport failure or exhausted
transient retry may conceal an accepted verdict, so it never triggers a
replacement. In particular, a response lost after acceptance can be followed
by a 409 when the same signed payload is retried after the agent changes state.
Platform can still refuse the fallback if the attempt has already closed.

Rust is the reference starter implementation, not a competition requirement.
Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Go, Rust, or any other implementation is accepted
when its root `Dockerfile` builds an image that serves the same `/health`,
`/seed`, and `/run` HTTP contract on port 8080. The screener never infers the
contract from a language manifest such as `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`,
`pyproject.toml`, or `go.mod`.

Source review exempts a submitted file from parts of its scrutiny only on an
exact `path + sha256` match against a runtime manifest,
`ditto_screener/data/starter-kit-provenance-v*.json`. The static preflight, the
L1 provenance block, and the L2 analyzer image all load that set, so adding a
manifest to it is an admission-relevant trust expansion that ships separately
from the kit change.

Every `miners/dittobench-starter-kit` change ships the next manifest, staged
outside the runtime set. Commit the kit change, then run
`scripts/generate_starter_provenance.py` from the repository root with the
next version number into `staged-starter-provenance/`. The generator refuses to
write into `ditto_screener/data/`. Screener CI runs on kit changes, and
`tests/test_starter_provenance_current.py` fails, printing the exact command,
until the newest manifest (staged or active) equals the kit's tracked,
submittable files. No runtime path, and neither screener image, reads
`staged-starter-provenance/`.

Activating a staged manifest is its own reviewed change. It is made only after
the independent canonical starter review described in the repository-root
`docs/canonical-starter-source-control.md` is recorded and reconciled with the
source-only fixture result, and only for a manifest whose files equal that
reviewed fixture archive exactly. Staged `v6` equals
`canonical-starter-v0.330.5.tgz`, and a test pins that. The activation change
moves the file unrenamed with
`git mv staged-starter-provenance/starter-kit-provenance-vN.json ditto_screener/data/`,
adds that revision to `test_supported_starter_manifests_are_versioned_and_distinct`
in `tests/test_l2_review.py`, keeps exact-file trust to the roles that evidence
supports, and is released and deployed like any screener change, which rebuilds
the analyzer image. Never edit or delete a published manifest, because older
honest derivatives must keep matching.

The only shared application boundary is the dependency-light
`packages/ditto-screening-protocol` package. It owns request/response models,
`AgentStatus`, `SCREENING_POLICY_VERSION`, artifact metadata, and the canonical
verdict-signing message. The worker does not import platform or subnet
application packages.

Private modules can rotate timing and relay tripwires, randomized controls,
source/fingerprint triage, and behavioral challenge packs without changing the
v9 protocol or signing bytes. No private signal proves causal model use.
Modules can pass or route to `retryable_infra`, `quarantine`, or `inconclusive`;
historical v10-v12 attempts also retain `pass_inconclusive` compatibility, while
the v13 wire contract rejects that fail-open outcome;
only the objective stable core can return `deterministic_reject`.

The worker also sends the optional signed, privacy-bounded fleet heartbeat
defined by the open platform fleet-health work. It reports only five-point
CPU/memory/disk buckets, aggregate Docker health/counts, worker state, and the
active agent ID. Heartbeat protocol v2 may also include one allowlisted stage
(`preparing`, `downloading`, `validating`, `building`, `starting`,
`health_check`, or `submitting`) and the current job's signed start time.

Heartbeat protocol v6 additionally announces the worker's own hardware, so an
operator can tell a node that is *slow* from a node that is *small*: logical
CPU count, physical cores when the kernel reports them, total RAM, the total
size of `/`, and the machine architecture. These are whole-unit sizes of the
machine, not an inventory of it — no hostname, serial, provider metadata,
image, mount layout, or free-space trace. They are sampled once at startup and
signed with the rest of the heartbeat, so a worker cannot advertise hardware
its hotkey did not sign for. A worker that cannot read its own hardware
reports at v5 rather than going dark.

The heartbeat never includes artifact contents, build output, dependency or
image metadata, policy internals, paths, prompts, evidence, or secrets. An
older platform can reject the optional endpoint without blocking or changing
screening.

## Local development

```bash
uv sync --group dev
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy ditto_screener packages/ditto-screening-protocol
uv run pytest -m "not integration"
docker build -t ditto-screener:local .
```

The real Docker core smoke test needs a canonical starter-kit checkout:

```bash
DITTO_STARTER_KIT_DIR=../../miners/dittobench-starter-kit \
  uv run pytest -m integration tests/test_gate_docker_integration.py -vv
```

Set `DITTOBENCH_API_DIR=/path/to/dittobench-api` as well to pass that exact
export through the real validator-side image loader during the integration test.

Pull requests retain the fast Python 3.12 unit suite, formatting, lint,
type-check, and production Docker image build gates. The full canonical-starter
build/health and isolated L2 coding-harness integration suite runs in
`Daily anti-cheat core E2E` every day at 08:17 UTC and on manual dispatch. Run
that workflow before merging changes to the real Docker gate or L2 analyzer
boundary when waiting for the next scheduled signal would be too risky.

## Runtime configuration

Required values are supplied through the production host's protected
`screener.env` file:

- `SCREENER_PLATFORM_API_URL`: platform API base URL.
- `SCREENER_API_TOKEN`: dedicated bearer token, at least 32 characters.
- `SCREENER_HOTKEY`: allowlisted public screener SS58 address.
- `SCREENER_WALLET_NAME` and `SCREENER_WALLET_HOTKEY`, or
  `SCREENER_MNEMONIC`: signing-key source. Prefer the host wallet.
- `SCREENER_GH_TOKEN_FILE`: optional path to a read-only token used only as a
  BuildKit secret for a private harness dependency.
- `SCREENER_POLICY_MANIFEST_FILE`: optional protected private manifest. When
  absent, the worker runs the production v8 Luna policy with no `/run` call.
- `SCREENER_REVIEW_JOURNAL_FILE`: optional protected append-only journal path
  for quarantine and inconclusive evidence.
- `SCREENER_AUDIT_SEED`: secret seed read only when a configured random-control
  module names this environment variable.
- `SCREENER_SOURCE_REVIEW_API_KEY_FILE`: required mode-0400 OpenRouter key file
  for the private read-only source reviewer. The default model is
  `openai/gpt-6-luna`.
- `SCREENER_SEED_PROBE_MODE`: `shadow` (default), `enforce`, or `off`. After
  the health gate, one bounded `POST /seed` wave with a single coined pair
  proves the image can ingest state, not just answer `/health`. `shadow`
  records the failure class as evidence beside the existing outcome;
  `enforce` makes it a deterministic contract failure whose detail tells the
  miner what to fix (writing outside `/tmp`, the sandbox memory cap, a non-2xx
  reply, or no reply). The probe is served by the same isolated fake gateway as
  the rest of the smoke, so it costs no provider call.
  `SCREENER_SEED_PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default `60`) bounds it, and
  `SCREENER_SEED_PATH` (default `/seed`) names the path. Whatever the mode
  decides, the probe also samples what the container consumed of the sandbox
  envelope (`memory.peak` and `/tmp`, the same cgroup files the validator reads
  after a scored run) and records it as `seed-envelope-usage` evidence on every
  screened image, passing ones included -- how close the fleet runs to the caps
  cannot be read from rejections alone. An image without a shell reports
  nothing and screening is unchanged.
- `SCREENER_V13_RUNTIME_RECEIPTS_MODE`: `off` (default) or `shadow`. The shadow
  mode sends bounded `/run` and `/seed` requests through the isolated smoke
  network and records digest-only, exact-attempt observations for V13 runtime
  checks 3–7. A receipt means `recorded_unverified`, never a pass: the fake
  model cannot establish actual tool choice, memory correctness, or user
  isolation. The mode has no influence on the screening outcome and should
  remain off until its overhead and evidence profile have been calibrated.
  A source hold before runtime leaves these checks `not_recorded`.
- `SCREENER_L2_REVIEW_MODE`: `off` (default), `shadow`, or `enforce`.
- `SCREENER_L2_REVIEW_MODEL`: defaults to `openai/gpt-6-sol`; legacy
  `moonshotai/kimi-k3` remains accepted only for a deliberate rollback.
  `SCREENER_L2_FALLBACK_MODELS` is the ordered OpenRouter model-failover chain
  (`z-ai/glm-5.2` by default). A fallback is used only after a
  model/routing error, never after a valid analyst response.
- `SCREENER_L3_REVIEW_ENABLED`: `true` (default) runs the independent SOL
  critic/adjudicator after L2. `false` keeps L1 routing and the L2 analyst
  active while making the L2 result authoritative. Platform review-settings
  revisions can change this between leases without a worker restart.
- `SCREENER_L3_REVIEW_MODEL`: defaults to `openai/gpt-6-sol`; both layers use
  OpenRouter ZDR routing and deny data collection.
- `SCREENER_L2_ANALYZER_IMAGE`: locked to the updater-built
  `ditto-screener-l2-analyzer:active` image.
- The signed screener worker runs each bounded reviewer `bash`, `rg`, or
  coreutils command in a disposable analyzer container. The submitted source
  is mounted read-only; the container has no network, secrets, or Docker socket.
  Model calls and API credentials stay in the worker process outside that
  container. Candidate build and execution remain separate screening stages.
- `SCREENER_L2_CACHE_DIR` and `SCREENER_L2_AUDIT_JOURNAL_FILE`: protected
  sanitized cache/audit locations. Raw source and transcripts are never stored.
- `SCREENER_SCORER_CAPABILITIES_URL` and `SCREENER_EXPECTED_SCORER_REVISION`:
  optional paired V13 L2 evidence gate. Point the URL at a trusted HTTPS
  scorer's exact `/v1/capabilities` endpoint and pin the compiled 40-character
  scorer release revision. L2 fetches a fresh, digest-bound list of variables
  injected into its V13 sandbox before using a cached review or calling a
  model. A missing, stale, env-asserted, or mismatched packet holds the review
  as inconclusive. The packet does not cover image ENV, source defaults, or
  other validator deployments; those need independent source and runtime
  checks before any CLEAR or emissions decision.
- `SCREENER_REQUIRE_SIGNED_RUNTIME_LEASE=true`: V13 canary gate that holds L2
  inconclusive before any model call unless Platform supplied a fresh signed
  cohort lease for the exact attempt and artifact. Set on the Platform process
  and on the signed screener workers.
  Leave it off for legacy screening; never treat an absent lease as CLEAR.
  V13 with L3 off requires the lease without this flag. Freshness is checked
  against claim receipt, not against each later use, so a long build or L1
  pass cannot age out a lease Platform just certified. A present lease that is
  stale at receipt or bound to another attempt, artifact, or policy is held
  inconclusive. A V13 arrival under policy 13 with no lease means the pinned
  scorer cohort was unavailable: that is retryable infrastructure,
  `l2-runtime-evidence-unavailable`, which Platform retries automatically, and
  Platform withholds such claims while the cohort is down. Any other arrival
  without a lease (for example a non-V13 arrival during an open rollout) keeps
  the inconclusive hold, so a per-agent cause never loops through that retry.
- `SCREENER_SIGNED_RUNTIME_LEASE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` (default `300`, 1-3600):
  oldest signed cohort observation accepted at claim receipt. The report-only
  L2 canary uses the same receipt-anchored rule.
- `SCREENER_STATIC_PREFLIGHT_V2_MODE`: `off` (default), `shadow`, or `enforce`.
  `off` and `shadow` preserve the v1 decisive result; `shadow` additionally
  computes the reachability-and-causality v2 candidate for comparison.
- `SCREENER_STATIC_PREFLIGHT_AUDIT_FILE`: protected mode-0600 JSONL journal for
  bounded v1/v2 shadow comparisons. Configure it before selecting `shadow`;
  an append failure is retryable infrastructure and prevents Docker execution.

Static preflight v2 makes a source match decisive only when both its effective
Docker/Cargo/runtime reachability and its category-specific source-to-sink flow
are proven. Code excluded from the effective build is inert. Test-only code
never makes a v2 match decisive, but the v1 detector scans it, including files
reached only through `cfg(test)`-gated `include!` or `#[path]`, because no build
flag can be proven off; a test-only match keeps its pre-build lead. Dynamic and
unsupported build or import forms remain advisory source-review leads. Roll out `shadow` first,
inspect only the sanitized private journal, and promote to `enforce` explicitly.

Static source matches remain pre-execution leads. In `shadow`/`enforce`, the
inert reviewer resolves them before any submission Dockerfile runs; only an L3
clearance may permit a high-risk static lead to continue to the build boundary.
An unresolved lead remains retryable, inconclusive, or quarantined and never
becomes a terminal automatic rejection.

Full source reviews also receive hashes of cited source windows from up to three
earlier, still-rejected submissions linked by the same hotkey or the exact
submission payment coldkey. Platform verifies each original archive digest and
the rejection's artifact binding before producing up to 32 windows of at most
five lines.
The worker searches at most 512 current files / 2 MiB in one archive pass;
spacing changes and moving code between files retain a match, while quoted
literal contents remain significant.

A match adds `rejected-ancestor-mechanism` locations to the existing inert
reviewer. It never certifies a violation or a clearance, and a remediated
submission can still pass. Missing or corrupt historical source is reported as
`rejected-ancestor-source-unavailable` evidence on audited verdicts without
blocking the current source fetch. Each historical fetch/parse has a 10-second
deadline, with at most three ancestors. Platform records lookup availability for
every source fetch, including passing jobs. Backroom's read-scoped
`get_screening_submission` exposes the latest artifact-bound lookup: `partial`
lists missing ancestor UUIDs, `available` means lookup completed (not policy
clearance), `mechanical_only` means it was skipped, and null means not recorded.
Mechanical-only work skips this supplemental review path. Older
Platform/worker versions ignore the additive metadata during rolling upgrades.

Source-review requests follow OpenRouter's app-attribution contract with
`HTTP-Referer: https://heyditto.ai` and `X-OpenRouter-Title: Ditto`.
